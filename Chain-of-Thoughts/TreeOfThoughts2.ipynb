As one of the largest players in the sector, ASML's supply chain is complex and far-reaching, involving numerous companies and organizations around the world. In this article, we will provide an overview of the supply chain relation map for ASML, highlighting key nodes and relationships.\n",

       "1. **ASML**: The central node in our supply chain relation map, ASML is a leading provider of semiconductor equipment.\n",
       "2. **Intel**: A major customer of ASML's products, Intel is one of the largest technology companies in the world.\n",
       "3. **Samsung**: Another significant customer of ASML's products, Samsung is a South Korean conglomerate with a strong presence in the electronics industry.\n",
       "4. **TSMC**: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is a leading independent semiconductor foundry and a major customer of ASML's products.\n",
       "5. **GlobalFoundries**: A global leader in the development and manufacturing of advanced semiconductor technologies, GlobalFoundries is also a significant customer of ASML's products.\n",

       "**Additional Nodes and Links**\n",
       "\n",
       "While the above nodes and relationships provide a comprehensive overview of ASML's supply chain relation map, it is important to note that this would likely be a simplified representation. In reality, the actual graph would include many more nodes and links, representing various other companies, organizations, and relationships involved in the semiconductor industry.\n",
       "\n",
       "For example, additional suppliers might include:\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Specialty Chemicals**: Companies that provide specialized chemicals used in ASML's manufacturing processes.\n",
       "* **Packaging Materials**: Suppliers of packaging materials, such as substrates and encapsulants, used to protect and support ASML's products.\n",
       "* **Assembly Services**: Providers of assembly services, like wire bonding and flip chip attachment, that support ASML's equipment development and manufacturing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Similarly, additional customers might include:\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Other Semiconductor Companies**: Firms that design, manufacture, and test their own semiconductor devices using ASML's equipment.\n",
       "* **Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)**: Companies that use ASML's products to produce electronic devices, such as smartphones, laptops, and servers.\n",
       "* **Research Institutions**: Organizations that conduct research and development in the field of semiconductors, often relying on ASML's equipment for their work.\n",
