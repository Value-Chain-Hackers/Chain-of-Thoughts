However, based on the simplified data provided, we can attempt to create a basic map that highlights some of the key stakeholders involved in ASML's supply chain.\n",

       "3. **ASML → Customers**: ASML sells its products to customers, including OEMs and end-users.\n",
       "4. **Customers → ASML**: Customers purchase products from ASML, driving demand for its goods and services.\n",
       "5. **Partners → ASML**: Partners collaborate with ASML on various initiatives, such as research and development or manufacturing projects.\n",
       "6. **ASML → Competitors**: ASML competes with other companies in the semiconductor industry for market share and customers.\n",

       "**Power Dynamics:**\n",
       "\n",
       "While this simplified map provides some insight into the stakeholders involved in ASML's supply chain, it does not capture the complex power dynamics that exist between these nodes. To create a more comprehensive map, we would need to gather more detailed information on the specific roles and influence of each stakeholder within ASML's supply chain.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Limitations:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Limited data**: The simplified data provided does not provide sufficient information to create a comprehensive power dynamics map.\n",
       "2. **Private company**: ASML is a private company, making it challenging to obtain internal information or access to its supply chain.\n",
       "3. **Complexity**: ASML's supply chain may involve multiple tiers of suppliers, customers, and partners, which could add complexity to the power dynamics.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Future Research Directions:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Analyzing external influences**: Investigate how market trends, technological advancements, and global events impact ASML's power dynamics.\n",
       "2. **Exploring stakeholder roles**: Delve deeper into the specific roles and influence of each stakeholder within ASML's supply chain.\n",
       "3. **Examining business performance**: Analyze how ASML's power dynamics relate to its business performance and market position.\n",

       "In conclusion, while we can attempt to create a basic supply chain power dynamics map for ASML based on limited data, the private nature of the company and complexity of its supply chain make it challenging to create a comprehensive map. Future research directions could provide valuable insights into ASML's operations and power dynamics."
